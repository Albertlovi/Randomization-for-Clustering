# Randomization-for-Clustering

This repository provides implementations of various clustering algorithms. The primary objective is to apply these 
algorithms to different datasets and analyze the resulting cluster configurations. Additionally, we define internal 
and external metrics to evaluate and compare the performance of the methods. We also include techniques to determine 
the optimal number of clusters for each method. To enhance understanding, the repository offers several plots that 
facilitate a more intuitive interpretation of the algorithms and their results.

The datasets folder contains custom datasets used across the different methods. Specifically, we include two distinct 
datasets to analyze different aspects of clustering performance.

The algorithms folder contains all the important code related to the three clustering algorithms studied. In order to run the algorithms we need to execute the Lloyd.py, DBSCAN.py and ().py files. Once they are executed, the corresponding results for this methods will appear in the folder of each method. Depending on the algorithm, the different folders for the methods also contain ready to run scripts regarding different metrics or implementations.
